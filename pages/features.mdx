## Input Blocking and Warning ‚≠ê

On page load, if the following two conditions are both met, automatically
block input elements (with stylized growl placeholders), removing the user's
ability to interact with them, and display a popup notification (in which the
user has controls to turn this behavior on or off).

1.  The page is classified as potentially untrusted.

2.  There are input elements on the page.

Exception:
If user has previously whitelisted the site (either temporarily or
persistently), the above behavior is overridden. The popup is still
displayed, however, to remind the user the domain was initially classified as
potentially suspicious, and to give them the opportunity to toggle back the
controls.

## Disable Blocking & Whitelist ‚≠ê

The extension's popup UI gives the user the opportunity to control growl's
behavior on the site now and in the future (that is, to remember the user's
choice in future browsing sessions and persist changes) through interactive buttons.
