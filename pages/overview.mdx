`growl` automatically sniffs out and defangs suspicious webpages, helping prevent phishing, fraud, and other digital scams.

When a webpage is flagged as potentially suspicious, users must "opt in" in
order to interact in certain ways with the site, like inputting credit-card
data, personal information, or otherwise sensitive content.

As such, `growl` complements built-in browser security measures such as Google Chrome's Safe Browsing feature, providing additional content-filtering protections
to enhance digital security.

`growl` is lightweight (and minimally obtrusive) -- but always has your back. It functions like a digital guardian or shoulder angel: As you browse, the extension is working hard in the background to detect threats and swinging into action to preempt them. Moreover, `growl` acts as a cybersecurity conscience of sorts, reminding users to stay vigilant with pop-out warnings upon detection of a suspicious site.

The computer security principles of _zero-trust_ and _security by default_
inspired `growl`'s core functionality.
